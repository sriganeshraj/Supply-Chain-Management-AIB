### Introduction to Supply Chain Management using blockchain technology
Supply chain management involves the coordination and integration of various activities and processes within a network of organizations that work together to deliver a product or service to end customers. Blockchain technology has emerged as a transformative tool in the field of supply chain management, offering transparency, security, and efficiency.

Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed ledger that records transactions across a network of computers. In the context of supply chain management, blockchain technology is used to create a transparent and tamper-resistant record of every transaction and movement of goods as they move through the supply chain.

### Detailed Explanation of System
A comprehensive and integrated system called supply chain management (SCM) manages the whole lifespan
of goods and services, from conception to delivery to customers. In-depth planning, procurement,
manufacturing, shipping, distribution, and inventory management are all part of this complex system. Demand
forecasting and production planning are both part of the planning process, which aims to match resources with
market demands. Choosing suppliers, settling contracts, and upholding goodwill are all aspects of sourcing.
The manufacturing or production stage emphasizes efficiency and quality control as it turns raw resources into
completed products or provides services. Logistics manages warehouse operations, optimizes transportation,
and oversees the actual movement of commodities. With the use of efficient order fulfilment procedures,
distribution makes sure that finished goods go to retailers or customers. Meeting demand while reducing
holding costs is a delicate balance that inventory management attempts to achieve.
Real-time tracking and decision-making depend heavily on information systems, which include tools like ERP
and data analytics. Collaboration and risk management with suppliers are fostered by supplier relationship
management (SRM). Supply is matched to customer expectations through demand management, while
interruptions are anticipated through risk management. Concerning moral and environmental issues,
sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) concepts are becoming more and more important.
Initiatives for continuous improvement are guided by performance measurement, which uses Key
Performance Indicators (KPIs). In order to improve productivity, cut costs, and guarantee customer
satisfaction, a successful SCM system integrates people, processes, and technology. In order to further improve
visibility, openness, and responsiveness throughout the supply chain, modern SCM incorporates technological
innovations.
