### Introduction to Supply Chain Management using blockchain technology
Supply chain management involves the coordination and integration of various activities and processes within a network of organizations that work together to deliver a product or service to end customers. Blockchain technology has emerged as a transformative tool in the field of supply chain management, offering transparency, security, and efficiency.

Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed ledger that records transactions across a network of computers. In the context of supply chain management, blockchain technology is used to create a transparent and tamper-resistant record of every transaction and movement of goods as they move through the supply chain.
